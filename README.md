# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-OF SYSTOLIC ARCHITECTURE IN MAC UNIT-VLSI
The central processing unit in a system performs complex operations. Processing time is the ultimate barrier during computations. The main motto is to improve the speed of operation by implementing Systolic Architecture. Systolic architecture is the arrangement of n number of processing elements in an array fashion.
